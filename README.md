# KPPLauncher
[KPPLauncher](https://github.com/lukas1h/KPPLauncher) is a MRPI package and KUAL extension that allows [react-native-kindle](https://github.com/Lukas1h/react-native-kindle) apps to be ran directly from the library, similer to the now unsuportted `kindlets`.

## Instalation
1. Grab the newest release. 
2. Drop the `Update_KPPLBooklet__install.bin` in your `mrpackages` folder on your Kindle
3. Run `;log mrpi` in the search bar, or use KUAL to install the package.

## Compatibility
Should work on anything above `v5.13.7`, as thats when React Native was released. 

`KPPLauncher` uses the obfusticated `Booklet` API and code from [KPVBooklet](https://github.com/koreader/kpvbooklet), which apparently doesn't work on newer frameware versions. That being said, it works on my device just fine, PW3 `v5.15.1` and `v5.14.2`.

### Tested on:
- PW3 on `v5.14.2` *thanks, martinpham*
- PW3 on `v5.15.1`
